      D2ArmorPicker (or short D2AP) is a small web-app to quickly find armor that fits your desired
      stat requirements. It uses the armor in your vault, inventory and postmaster, calculates every
      possible variation and shows only those that fulfill the given requirements.
      <br />
      <br />
      As I raided a lot and I mainly play meme builds, I wanted to be able to switch exotics and
      have decent stats without being a burden on my team. That's why I developed the
      <a href="https://github.com/Mijago/D2-Gear-Calculator" target="_blank"
        >first version of this tool</a
      >
      in Python. After a few days I started to translate this tool
      <a href="https://mijago.github.io/D2GearCalculator/" target="_blank">into a webpage</a>. My
      friends liked it, but it didn't have API access. Thus I created the first version of
      D2ArmorPicker, and after people started using and liking it, I started to completely rewrite
      it - that's Version&nbsp;2!
      <br />
      <br />
      I keep updating and improving this tool, but beware that it takes a bit, as I work on it on my
      spare time. Feel free to follow me on Twitter
      <a href="https://twitter.com/MijagoCoding/" target="_blank"
        ><img alt="Me on twitter" class="logo-twitter" src="assets/logo-twitter.png" /></a

      <mat-card-title> How do I use D2ArmorPicker? </mat-card-title>
    </mat-card-header>
    <mat-card-content>
      Follow these few steps:
      <ol>
        <li>Login. You already did this!</li>
        <li>
          [Optional] Pick an exotic you want to use. The tool will only display results for this
          exotic. You can always undo this.
        </li>
        <li>
          [Optional] Select additional mods/fragments that give a bonus (or penalty). These are
          important if you want certain stat combinations even if you have penalties on your gear.
        </li>
        <li>
          Select the stat distribution you seek. This is the heart of D2ArmorPicker. You just click
          100 recovery and it will display you builds that have 100 recovery.
          <i>Note that it automatically adds stat mods if necessary.</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          Now look to the result table. On a normal desktop it should be on the right, on smaller
          devices it might move below the configuration. The table lists multiple results and you
          can sort it by your requirements.<br />
          <b>Click</b> on an entry to open look the detailed view:
          <div class="preview-image-container">
            <img
              alt="Preview of the results table"
              class="preview-image"
              src="assets/armor-images/preview_result_details.png" />
          </div>
          The example above shows a build that utilizes Dunemarchers and a zero-waste-build. To
          achieve it, I have to move all the items in my inventory and equip them. After this, I
          <i>masterwork</i> them and <i>add the mods</i> as the table displays them:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Discipline:</b> One major mod, one minor mod;</li>
            <li><b>Intellect:</b> One major mod, one minor mod;</li>
            <li><b>Strength:</b> One major mod;</li>
            <li
              >I also add Powerful Friends and Radiant Light, as I chose them in the
              configuration.</li
            >
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </mat-card-content>

  <mat-card appearance="outlined">

      <mat-card-title> Where can I grind high stat armor? </mat-card-title>
    </mat-card-header>
    <mat-card-content>
      There are many spots that give you mediocre armor, but for the really good builds you need the
      correct armor. Here I provide a list of high-stat armor sources. It may not be complete, but a
      good starting point.
      <i>Last updated February 8, 2022.</i>

      <ul>
        <li> Farm legendary Dares!</li>
        <li>
          Clear Pit of Heresy Dungeon, the boss drop guarantees two stats to be 16 (or higher).</li
        >
        <li>
          Farm a bunch of Spoils, go into Master Vault of Glass and buy armor at the final
          chest.</li
        >
        <li> The list will be extended sometime in Witch Queen!</li>
      </ul>
      Some good armor rolls may look like these:
