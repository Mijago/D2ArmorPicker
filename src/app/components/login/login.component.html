      This tool allows you to select the optimal armor from your inventory and vault to satisfy your stat needs.
      It also tells you which stat mods you have to use!

      You have to log in to enable this tool to grab your armor from the API.<br/>

      D2ArmorPicker uses the Bungie.net api and it's OAuth authorization.
      You log in on an official Bungie.net page and D2ArmorPicker receives a temporary login token from Bungie.
      That means it does not receive your credentials.

          First, you are able to select the stats you want.
          The tool will automatically parse all your armor (including your vault and your postmaster), and then show you
          which stat selections are even possible with your current gear.
          The tool also shows you all possible loadouts with three or four stats at 100!

          <br/>
          There are also additional settings.
          You can add stasis fragments and  negative and positive stat mods to your builds.
          Also, you can select 0-waste builds (so only flat numbers).
          D2ArmorPicker will also add stat mods to reduce wasted stats wherever possible!

          D2ArmorPicker will show you a table with many results.
          You can sort and filter it, and then you click on one row to see which items are needed for your desired stats.

          The page will also give you a detailed description of what you have to do in order to get to your desired build.
          The following screenshot shows one of the more detailed descriptions:

            Armor Clustering

            For the time when your vault is overflowing.

        <div>
          Since version 2.0.14, D2ArmorPicker has an armor clustering feature.
          This means that it takes all your armor and groups it in 25 groups, where all items in one group has very similar stats.
          This can help you to clear out your vault, especially from duplicated armor rolls.

          Take Cluster 1, for example.
          I copy the DIM-Query, enter it into DIM and see the following results:
